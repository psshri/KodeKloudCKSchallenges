### Sharing my personal experience while solving this challenge.

**TL;DR** 
When I started out with this challenge, I had only administrative knowledge on K8s and almost no experience working with K8s security. But I was still able to solve these challenges by learning concepts on the go, which I have mentioned in my detailed step-by-step solution.

My objective behind describing all these methods is to demonstrate how one can go about completing a task with minimum prior knowledge and with trial & error. And in the process, we learn a lot of new things. There is a good metaphor I really look upto, you should throw yourself in a swimming pool and you'll automatically learn how to keep your head above the water level and slowly you will learn how to navigate in an unknown territory.
